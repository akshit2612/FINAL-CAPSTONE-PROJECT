    "## Feature Engineering and Dynamic Pricing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We add new columns to the data stream for parsed datetime (`t`) and the day (`day`). Then, we define a daily tumbling window to aggregate data and compute a dynamic price. The pricing formula is based on the difference between maximum and minimum occupancy within the window, normalized by capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demand Function and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simplified model, our 'demand' is implicitly represented by the fluctuation in occupancy within a day. The greater the difference between the peak and low occupancy, the higher the implied demand volatility, suggesting potential scarcity. This fluctuation is normalized by the parking lot's capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pricing Formula:**\n",
    "`price = base_price + demand_fluctuation`\n",
    "where:\n",
    "`base_price = 10` (fixed minimum price)\n",
    "`demand_fluctuation = (occ_max - occ_min) / cap`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "*   **Occupancy Fluctuation as Demand Proxy:** We assume that a larger swing between daily maximum and minimum occupancy indicates higher demand or more dynamic usage patterns.\n",
    "*   **Fixed Base Price:** A base price of $10 is set as a minimum. This could be adjusted based on operational costs or desired profit margins.\n",
    "*   **Linear Relationship:** The demand fluctuation is added linearly to the base price. More complex, non-linear relationships could be explored for refined pricing.\n",
    "*   **No External Factors (in this model):** This model does not explicitly account for external factors like special events, traffic, or competitor pricing. These would be incorporated in more advanced models (like Model 2 and Model 3 discussed in the report).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Price Changes with Demand and Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific notebook's implementation (Model 1), the price primarily changes with the *fluctuation in demand* as measured by the daily occupancy range. Higher fluctuations lead to higher prices. Competition is not directly modeled here, but in a full system (as described in the accompanying report), competitive pricing would involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Competitive Pricing Model (Model 3):** This model would analyze prices and occupancy of nearby parking lots. If a competitor is significantly cheaper and has availability, the system might suggest lowering the price or rerouting vehicles. Conversely, if competitors are more expensive, the system could increase prices to maximize revenue while remaining competitive.\n",
    "*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously adjusts prices based on real-time data, allowing it to respond quickly to changes in demand and competitive landscape.\n"
